        <p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[9] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

            Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A preview build was released shortly thereafter.[10]
            
            On November 18, 2015, the source of Visual Studio Code was released under the MIT License, and made available on GitHub. Extension support was also announced.[11] On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the Web.[12] Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code's source code on GitHub under the permissive MIT License,[5][13] while the releases by Microsoft are proprietary freeware.[7]</p>
